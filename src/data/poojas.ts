    about: "Participate in the First Ashlesha Nakshatra Gokarna Special Ashlesha Naga Bali Puja to remove the malicious effects of Sarpa (Naga) Dosha and clean karmic sins.\n\nLife stuck between obstacles and nightmares?\nAppease the powerful Serpent deities (Nagas) on this auspicious First Ashlesha Nakshatra of 2026 to end all your sufferings for the rest of the year.\n\nSarpa Doshas, also known as Naga Doshas, are seen as the result of divine displeasure and karmic links to serpent deities in past births. In Vedic astrology, Sarpa Doshas in a person’s horoscope are believed to bring various problems and obstacles in life. They are believed to cast a deep shadow over their life, silently disrupting relationships, causing painful delays in marriage, unexplained fertility problems, chronic illnesses, and financial losses. Left unaddressed, they can lead to repeated failures, emotional turmoil, and a life marked by suffering.\n\nSignificance of Ashlesha Nakshatra, and Ashlesha Naag Bali Puja:\nAshlesha Nakshatra is an important star in Vedic astrology, linked to serpent energy and known for transformation, hidden knowledge, and deep emotions. It is symbolised by a coiled serpent and is believed to be the most powerful time to perform remedies for Sarpa Dosha, as serpent energies are most active and receptive. The upcoming one is the first Ashlesha Nakshatra of 2026. So, during this special time, a powerful Ashlesha Naaga Bali puja is being organised to help reduce Sarpa Dosha and enter the new year with peace and prosperity.\n\nAshlesha Naag Bali is a powerful Vedic ritual performed to appease the divine Naga Devatas. When performed during this auspicious Nakshatra, it directly accesses and neutralises the negative effects of Sarpa Dosha in one's horoscope and is said to bring divine blessings into one's life. Offerings like milk, flowers, and rice that are favourite to the Naga Devatas are made on Vigrahas or Bimbas of Naga Devatas to appease them, enhancing prosperity, health, and peace.",
